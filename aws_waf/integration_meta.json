AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the AWS resource that AWS WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response."
